Here’s a set of 5 advanced code examples to foster and implement a bold culture across a system, focusing on human-computer interaction (HCI) and socio-technical dynamics. These examples establish mechanisms to encourage and normalize bold actions through positive reinforcement, feedback loops, and cultural signals within a team setting. The examples also consider the ethical and psychological aspects of fostering boldness, ensuring it is both empowering and sustainable.

### Code Examples

1. **Adaptive Feedback System for Recognizing Bold Actions**  
   This example builds a system that recognizes and positively reinforces bold actions taken by team members in real-time, based on pre-defined criteria. The system gives immediate feedback, encouraging further bold actions.

   ```python
   import random

   def recognize_bold_action(action):
       bold_actions = ["propose new project", "challenge existing process", "initiate creative discussion"]
       if action in bold_actions:
           feedback = random.choice(["Well done on taking the initiative!", "Bold move! Keep it up!", "Great job pushing boundaries!"])
           return feedback
       return "Good job!"

   # Example usage
   print(recognize_bold_action("propose new project"))
   ```

2. **Confidence Boosting Bot for Boldness Support**  
   This chatbot provides tailored responses and resources to team members, encouraging them to act boldly. The bot uses natural language processing (NLP) to detect language patterns related to hesitation and suggests a positive, supportive response.

   ```python
   import re

   def boldness_bot(message):
       if re.search(r"\b(should I|could I|not sure)\b", message):
           return "Trust your instincts! Taking action is a step forward. Go for it!"
       else:
           return "Keep up the bold work!"

   # Example usage
   print(boldness_bot("I'm not sure if I should propose this idea"))
   ```

3. **Gamification for Bold Actions with Reward Points**  
   Introduces a gamified system that assigns reward points for bold actions. The system provides visibility into the team's contributions and fosters friendly competition, further normalizing boldness.

   ```python
   team_points = {}

   def reward_bold_action(member, action):
       points = 10 if action == "innovate" else 5
       team_points[member] = team_points.get(member, 0) + points
       return f"{member} awarded {points} points for {action}!"

   # Example usage
   print(reward_bold_action("Alice", "innovate"))
   print(team_points)
   ```

4. **Sentiment Analysis for Real-Time Boldness Feedback**  
   This code integrates sentiment analysis to monitor bold contributions during team discussions. It dynamically adjusts the feedback tone, giving more reinforcement if the sentiment is hesitant or cautious, which can boost confidence.

   ```python
   from textblob import TextBlob

   def boldness_sentiment_analysis(message):
       sentiment = TextBlob(message).sentiment.polarity
       if sentiment < 0.3:
           return "Your idea is bold—go ahead! We're behind you."
       return "Keep pushing those great ideas forward!"

   # Example usage
   print(boldness_sentiment_analysis("I'm thinking this might be risky, but..."))
   ```

5. **Highlighting Bold Actions in Team Dashboards**  
   Creates a dashboard module that highlights recent bold actions by team members. The module integrates into the team’s main dashboard, ensuring visibility and celebrating boldness across the system.

   ```python
   bold_actions_log = []

   def log_bold_action(member, action):
       bold_actions_log.append(f"{member} took bold action: {action}")
       return f"Action logged for {member}: {action}"

   def display_bold_actions():
       return "\n".join(bold_actions_log)

   # Example usage
   log_bold_action("Bob", "introduced new workflow")
   print(display_bold_actions())
   ```

---

### Summary
These code examples create a system-wide cultural transformation by embedding boldness as a core value in the team. They recognize, reinforce, and celebrate bold actions through feedback, gamification, sentiment analysis, and high visibility, ensuring that team members feel supported in acting boldly. This suite of tools bridges HCI principles and socio-technical interactions, cultivating a strong culture of initiative, confidence, and collaborative risk-taking.
