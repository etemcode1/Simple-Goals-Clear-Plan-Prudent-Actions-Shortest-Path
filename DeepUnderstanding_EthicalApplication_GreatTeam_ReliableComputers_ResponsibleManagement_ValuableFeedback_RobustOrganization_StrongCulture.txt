Good engineering practice (GEP) is engineering and technical activities that ensure that a company manufactures products of the required quality as expected (e.g., by the relevant regulatory authorities). Good engineering practices are to ensure that the development and/or manufacturing effort consistently generates deliverables that support the requirements for qualification or validation. Good engineering practices are applied to all industries that require engineering.[1]

Good documentation practice (recommended to abbreviate as GDocP to distinguish from "good distribution practice" also abbreviated GDP) is a term in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries to describe standards by which documents are created and maintained. While some GDocP standards are codified by various competent authorities, others are not but are considered cGMP (with emphasis on the "c", or "current"). Some competent authorities release or adopt guidelines, and they may include non-codified GDocP expectations. While not law, authorities will inspect against these guidelines and cGMP expectations in addition to the legal requirements and make comments or observations if departures are seen. In the past years, the application of GDocP is also expanding to cosmetic industry, excipient and ingredient manufacturers.

GDocP standards
Documentation creation
Contemporaneous with the event they describe[1]: ¶4.8 [2][3][4]
Not handwritten (except for handwritten entries thereon)[1]: ¶4.6 
When electronically produced, the documentation must be checked for accuracy[1][page needed]
Free from errors[2][5]
For some types of data, it is recommended that records are in a format that permits trend evaluation[6]
Document approval
Approved, signed, and dated by appropriate authorized personnel [1]: ¶4.3 [4][7]
Handwritten entries
Adequate space is provided for expected handwritten entries[1]: ¶4.6 [3]
Handwritten entries are in indelible ink[1]: ¶4.6 [3][4]
Errors (i.e. misspelling, illegible entries, etc.) are corrected and reason is documented
Critical entries must be independently checked (SPV, or second person verified)[1][page needed][7]
No spaces for handwritten entries are left blank – if unused, they are crossed out or "N/A" (or similar text) entered
Ditto marks or continuation lines are not acceptable[8]
Correction fluid are not allowed to be used in correcting errors
A stamp in lieu of a handwritten signature is not acceptable
Copies of documents
Clear, legible[1][page needed][3][9]
Errors are not introduced[1]: ¶4.2 [3][7]
Document maintenance
Regularly reviewed and kept current[1]: ¶4.5 [5]
Retained and available for appropriate duration[1]: ¶4.12 [5][6][7][9]
Electronic document management systems are validated[5]
Electronic records are backed up[5]
Document modification
Handwritten modifications are signed and dated[1]: ¶4.9 [2][3][4]
Altered text is not obscured (e.g., no correction fluid)[1]: ¶4.9 [2][3][4]
Where appropriate, the reason for alteration must be noted[1]: ¶4.9 [2][3][7]
Controls exist to prevent the inadvertent use of superseded documents[3][9]
Electronic versions can only be modified by authorized personnel[2]
A history (audit trail) must be maintained of changes and deletions to electronic versions[2][4][5]
Supporting documents can be added to the original document as an attachment for clarification or recording data. Attachments should be referenced at least once within the original document. Ideally, each page of the attachment is clearly identified (i.e. labeled as "Attachment X", "Page X of X", signed and dated by person who attached it, etc.)
GDocP interpretation
From the regulatory guidance above, additional expectations or allowances can be inferred by extension. Among these are:

Prohibition against removing pages[10] – the removal of a page would obscure the data that were present, so this is not permissible.
Page numbering[10] – the addition of page numbers, particularly in "Page x of y" format, allows a reviewer to ensure that there are no missing pages.
Stamped signatures in Asia – the culture of certain Asian countries, and the controls they employ, are such that their use of a stamp in lieu of handwritten signatures has been accepted.
Date and time formats[10] – dates may be written in a variety of formats that can be confusing if read by personnel with a different cultural background. In the context where different cultures interact, a date such as "07-05-10" can have numerous different meanings and therefore, by GDocP standards above, violates the requirement for being clear.
Transcription[10] – a transcription of data, where the original document is not retained, effectively obscures the original data and would be prohibited. Transcription may be helpful where the original is of poor quality writing or is physically damaged, but it should be clearly marked as a transcription and the original retained nevertheless.
Scrap paper, Post-it notes – intentionally recording raw data on non-official records is a set-up for transcription and is therefore prohibited.
Avoiding asterisks as part of the notation of a hand-change – where insufficient white space permits a fully notated hand change, a common practice is to use an asterisk (or other mark) near the correction, and elsewhere record the same mark and the notation. The risk is that additional changes are made by another person who uses the same mark, and now the notation can be interpreted to apply to all changes with the mark. Some will therefore advise against the use of the asterisk.[10] Others will accept it, if the notation clearly includes the number of changes that it applies to, such as, "* Three entries changed above due to entry errors. KAM 13-Jan-2011". There are no known instances of an agency rejecting such a notation.
Enforcement
The competent authorities are empowered to inspect establishments to enforce the law and the interpretations of the law (e.g., the content of guidance documents and the cGMPs).

Departures from GDocP that involved the regulator have included: documentation not contemporaneous,[11][12] use of ditto marks,[13] signature stamps.,[14][15] obscured original data,[16] Use of pencil,[16] inaccurate records,[16] and not dating changes.[17]

Working–Hotelling procedure

Interaction cost can comprise work, costs, and other expenses, required to complete a task or interaction. This applies to several categories, including:

Economy: the interaction cost of purchase includes the requirements to complete it and differs in costs for customers and vendors. The method of payment offered may factor into both transaction cost and interaction cost. Reducing steps for customers can be a service offered by the vendor.[1] Interaction costs should be considered when clients choose vendors.[2] Customers prefer to have a choice about their interaction cost.[3] In self-checkout, work is moved to the customer.
Politics: Specific interaction costs can be increased by law for political gains.[4]
User interface: In a computer menu with a graphical user interface, some designs require more clicks from the user in order to make a selection. With a dropdown menu, one click (or touch or hover) may reveal a hidden menu (sub-menu), with a second click required to select the menu option. If the entire menu were displayed all along, as in a navigation bar, only one click would be required, but the menu would occupy more screen space. Sub-menus require even more care from the user to make a desired selection.[5]

In telecommunication, a Berger code is a unidirectional error detecting code, named after its inventor, J. M. Berger. Berger codes can detect all unidirectional errors. Unidirectional errors are errors that only flip ones into zeroes or only zeroes into ones, such as in asymmetric channels. The check bits of Berger codes are computed by counting all the zeroes in the information word, and expressing that number in natural binary. If the information word consists of 
n
{\displaystyle n} bits, then the Berger code needs 
k
=
⌈
log
2
⁡
(
n
+
1
)
⌉
{\displaystyle k=\lceil \log _{2}(n+1)\rceil } "check bits", giving a Berger code of length k+n. (In other words, the 
k
{\displaystyle k} check bits are enough to check up to 
n
=
2
k
−
1
{\displaystyle n=2^{k}-1} information bits). Berger codes can detect any number of one-to-zero bit-flip errors, as long as no zero-to-one errors occurred in the same code word. Similarly, Berger codes can detect any number of zero-to-one bit-flip errors, as long as no one-to-zero bit-flip errors occur in the same code word. Berger codes cannot correct any error.

Like all unidirectional error detecting codes, Berger codes can also be used in delay-insensitive circuits.

Unidirectional error detection
As stated above, Berger codes detect any number of unidirectional errors. For a given code word, if the only errors that have occurred are that some (or all) bits with value 1 have changed to value 0, then this transformation will be detected by the Berger code implementation. To understand why, consider that there are three such cases:

Some 1s bit in the information part of the code word have changed to 0s.
Some 1s bits in the check (or redundant) portion of the code word have changed to 0s.
Some 1s bits in both the information and check portions have changed to 0s.
For case 1, the number of 0-valued bits in the information section will, by definition of the error, increase. Therefore, our Berger check code will be lower than the actual 0-bit-count for the data, and so the check will fail.

For case 2, the number of 0-valued bits in the information section have stayed the same, but the value of the check data has changed. Since we know some 1s turned into 0s, but no 0s have turned into 1s (that's how we defined the error model in this case), the encoded binary value of the check data will go down (e.g., from binary 1011 to 1010, or to 1001, or 0011). Since the information data has stayed the same, it has the same number of zeros it did before, and that will no longer match the mutated check value.

For case 3, where bits have changed in both the information and the check sections, notice that the number of zeros in the information section has gone up, as described for case 1, and the binary value stored in the check portion has gone down, as described for case 2. Therefore, there is no chance that the two will end up mutating in such a way as to become a different valid code word.

A similar analysis can be performed, and is perfectly valid, in the case where the only errors that occur are that some 0-valued bits change to 1. Therefore, if all the errors that occur on a specific codeword all occur in the same direction, these errors will be detected. For the next code word being transmitted (for instance), the errors can go in the opposite direction, and they will still be detected, as long as they all go in the same direction as each other.

Unidirectional errors are common in certain situations. For instance, in flash memory, bits can more easily be programmed to a 0 than can be reset to a 1.
