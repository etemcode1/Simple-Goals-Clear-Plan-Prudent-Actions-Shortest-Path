Here are **10 advanced code examples** demonstrating the principle of *winning at the margins* through accurate modeling, practical reasoning, and feedback-driven decision-making. These examples focus on achieving incremental improvements in operations and decision-making while ensuring compatibility with hardware and software systems.

### **1. Marginal Cost Optimization in Manufacturing**
Optimize the marginal cost per unit for a production line using real-time sensor data and predictive analytics.

```python
import numpy as np

def marginal_cost(units_produced, fixed_cost=10000, variable_cost=5):
    total_cost = fixed_cost + variable_cost * units_produced
    marginal = np.diff(total_cost) / np.diff(units_produced)
    return marginal

# Simulate real-time data
units = np.arange(1, 101)
costs = marginal_cost(units)

print(f"Marginal costs for incremental production units: {costs}")
```

### **2. Dynamic Pricing for Marginal Revenue Maximization**
Implement dynamic pricing using historical sales data to increase marginal revenue.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def dynamic_pricing(sales_data):
    model = LinearRegression()
    X = sales_data[['price']].values
    y = sales_data['quantity'].values
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    optimal_price = -model.coef_[0] / (2 * model.intercept_)
    return optimal_price

# Example data
data = pd.DataFrame({'price': [10, 15, 20, 25], 'quantity': [100, 80, 60, 40]})
price = dynamic_pricing(data)
print(f"Optimal price for maximizing revenue: ${price:.2f}")
```

### **3. Incremental Improvement in Supply Chain Efficiency**
Model transportation logistics to optimize delivery time with marginal gains.

```python
import networkx as nx

def optimize_delivery(graph, source, target):
    shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(graph, source=source, target=target, weight='time')
    return shortest_path

# Simulate a supply chain network
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_weighted_edges_from([
    ('A', 'B', 5), ('B', 'C', 10), ('A', 'C', 12), ('C', 'D', 3)
], weight='time')

path = optimize_delivery(G, 'A', 'D')
print(f"Optimized delivery route: {path}")
```

---

### **4. Feedback-Driven Decision Making for Retail Operations**
Integrate customer feedback into restocking decisions to improve profitability at the margin.

```python
import numpy as np

def prioritize_restocking(feedback_scores, sales_data):
    weights = np.array(feedback_scores) * np.array(sales_data)
    priority = np.argsort(-weights)
    return priority

# Simulate feedback scores and sales data
feedback = [4.5, 3.8, 5.0, 4.2]
sales = [150, 120, 200, 180]
restocking_priority = prioritize_restocking(feedback, sales)

print(f"Restocking priority (index order): {restocking_priority}")
```

### **5. Predictive Maintenance for Marginal Gains in Machine Uptime**
Use machine learning to predict and prevent equipment failures.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def predictive_maintenance(features, labels, new_data):
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(features, labels)
    predictions = model.predict(new_data)
    return predictions

# Example data
features = np.random.rand(100, 5)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
new_data = np.random.rand(1, 5)
maintenance = predictive_maintenance(features, labels, new_data)

print(f"Maintenance needed: {maintenance[0]}")
```

### **6. Marginal Gains in Marketing Effectiveness**
Optimize marketing ROI by identifying the most effective channels.

```python
import pandas as pd

def roi_analysis(data):
    data['ROI'] = data['Revenue'] / data['Cost']
    best_channels = data.sort_values(by='ROI', ascending=False)
    return best_channels

# Example marketing data
marketing_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Channel': ['Email', 'Social Media', 'TV', 'Print'],
    'Cost': [5000, 10000, 20000, 8000],
    'Revenue': [20000, 50000, 80000, 20000]
})
best_channels = roi_analysis(marketing_data)

print("Best marketing channels based on ROI:")
print(best_channels)
```

---

### **7. Resource Allocation with Marginal Productivity**
Maximize productivity by reallocating resources incrementally.

```python
def allocate_resources(productivities, resources):
    ratios = productivities / resources
    best_allocation = np.argsort(-ratios)
    return best_allocation

# Example productivity and resource data
productivities = np.array([100, 150, 200])
resources = np.array([50, 70, 100])
allocation = allocate_resources(productivities, resources)

print(f"Optimal resource allocation order: {allocation}")
```

### **8. Real-Time Inventory Optimization with IoT**
Implement real-time inventory management for marginal gains in stock availability.

```python
import random

def inventory_update(current_stock, sales_rate, replenishment_rate):
    new_stock = current_stock - sales_rate + replenishment_rate
    return max(new_stock, 0)

# Simulate real-time inventory updates
stock = 100
for t in range(10):
    sales = random.randint(5, 15)
    replenishment = random.randint(5, 10)
    stock = inventory_update(stock, sales, replenishment)
    print(f"Stock after time {t}: {stock}")
```

### **9. Continuous Improvement with Action Learning**
Simulate iterative learning cycles to improve operational accuracy.

```python
def action_learning(goal, iterations, improvement_rate=0.05):
    results = []
    for i in range(iterations):
        goal *= (1 + improvement_rate)
        results.append(goal)
    return results

# Example learning cycle
initial_goal = 100
cycles = 10
improvements = action_learning(initial_goal, cycles)

print(f"Improved goals over {cycles} cycles: {improvements}")
```

### **10. Goal Setting and Feedback in AI Operations**
Integrate dynamic goal setting with feedback loops for AI-driven operations.

```python
def dynamic_goal_adjustment(initial_goal, feedback_scores):
    for score in feedback_scores:
        adjustment = 1 + (score - 0.5) * 0.1
        initial_goal *= adjustment
    return initial_goal

# Example dynamic feedback
initial_goal = 100
feedback = [0.6, 0.8, 0.4, 0.9]
final_goal = dynamic_goal_adjustment(initial_goal, feedback)

print(f"Final adjusted goal: {final_goal}")
```

These examples offer practical, actionable ways to implement *winning at the margins* in diverse areas like manufacturing, marketing, supply chain, and AI-driven operations. Each example integrates realistic logic, iterative improvements, and feedback loops for decision-making and continuous development success.
