### Introduction: Complex Tracking Mechanism for Spiteful Behavior Based on Self-Determination Theory

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) emphasizes autonomy, competence, and relatedness as key drivers of human motivation and behavior. In this context, a robust system to track, address, and deprogram spiteful behavior must respect individual autonomy while promoting a supportive environment for behavioral change. The following system incorporates Full Stack solutions, informed by SDT, to track behaviors, foster intrinsic motivation for positive change, and reward cooperative, non-spiteful actions. Each example integrates deeper behavioral science principles to promote lasting transformation while maintaining an individual’s sense of control and self-worth.

### Example 1: **Behavioral Autonomy Monitoring with Self-Regulation Insights**

```c
// Backend: Track both autonomous and controlled behavior with respect to SDT
struct BehaviorMetricsSDT {
    int spiteful_actions;
    int cooperative_actions;
    float self_regulation_score;
    float perceived_autonomy;
};

void updateBehaviorMetricsSDT(int employee_id, int action_type) {
    BehaviorMetricsSDT *metrics = getEmployeeMetricsSDT(employee_id);
    if (action_type == 1) {
        metrics->spiteful_actions++;
    } else if (action_type == 0) {
        metrics->cooperative_actions++;
    }
    metrics->self_regulation_score = (metrics->cooperative_actions - metrics->spiteful_actions) / 10.0;
    metrics->perceived_autonomy = metrics->self_regulation_score * 1.5; // High autonomy correlates with better regulation
}
```

This complex metric system adds dimensions for self-regulation and perceived autonomy, aligning with SDT’s emphasis on fostering intrinsic motivation through autonomy.

### Example 2: **SDT-Driven Behavioral Dashboard for Self-Reflection**

```javascript
// Frontend: Display metrics with a focus on self-determined motivations
function displayBehaviorMetricsSDT(employeeId) {
    let metrics = getMetricsFromServer(employeeId);
    document.getElementById('spiteful-actions').innerHTML = metrics.spiteful_actions;
    document.getElementById('cooperative-actions').innerHTML = metrics.cooperative_actions;
    document.getElementById('self-regulation-score').innerHTML = metrics.self_regulation_score;
    document.getElementById('perceived-autonomy').innerHTML = metrics.perceived_autonomy;
    document.getElementById('motivation-feedback').innerHTML = generateMotivationFeedback(metrics);
}

function generateMotivationFeedback(metrics) {
    if (metrics.self_regulation_score > 8) {
        return "You are demonstrating strong self-determination and autonomy!";
    } else if (metrics.perceived_autonomy < 5) {
        return "Focus on autonomy-driven choices to improve overall self-regulation.";
    } else {
        return "Keep improving your cooperative actions to enhance team synergy!";
    }
}
```

This dashboard not only displays metrics but also provides personalized feedback that enhances the individual’s intrinsic motivation and autonomy.

### Example 3: **Autonomy-Supportive Machine Learning Behavior Prediction**

```python
# Backend: Predict future behavior while considering autonomy levels
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def predict_spiteful_behavior_sdt(employee_data):
    clf = RandomForestClassifier()
    clf.fit(employee_data['features'], employee_data['spiteful_labels'])
    predictions = clf.predict(employee_data['new_data'])
    # Modify prediction if perceived autonomy is low, as lack of autonomy may drive negative behavior
    return [adjust_prediction_based_on_autonomy(p, autonomy) for p, autonomy in zip(predictions, employee_data['autonomy'])]
    
def adjust_prediction_based_on_autonomy(prediction, autonomy_level):
    if autonomy_level < 5 and prediction == 1:
        return 0  # If autonomy is low, provide an opportunity for positive behavioral correction
    return prediction
```

In this example, machine learning predictions are adjusted based on an employee’s perceived autonomy, recognizing that a lack of autonomy may lead to negative behavior, which can be preemptively corrected.

---

### Example 4: **Positive Reinforcement Based on Competence Development**

```javascript
// Frontend: Notify employees of positive competence development based on cooperative behavior
function sendCompetenceFeedback(employeeId) {
    let msg = "You're improving in collaboration, a key skill for competence and success!";
    if (isCompetenceDevelopmentHigh(employeeId)) {
        msg += " Keep fostering these behaviors to increase your overall competence.";
    }
    sendNotification(employeeId, msg);
}
```

This system focuses on competence, another key aspect of SDT, by notifying employees of their growth and encouraging further development.

---

### Example 5: **Spiteful Behavior Alerts with Autonomy-Supportive Intervention**

```c
// Backend: Trigger an alert if spiteful behavior surpasses threshold, but intervention respects autonomy
void checkBehaviorThresholdSDT(int employee_id) {
    BehaviorMetricsSDT *metrics = getEmployeeMetricsSDT(employee_id);
    if (metrics->spiteful_actions > 5 && metrics->perceived_autonomy < 3) {
        suggestSelfDirectedIntervention(employee_id);
    } else if (metrics->spiteful_actions > 5) {
        sendAlertToHR(employee_id);
    }
}

void suggestSelfDirectedIntervention(int employee_id) {
    // Allow the employee to take control of their improvement process
    sendSuggestionToEmployee(employee_id, "Consider attending our autonomy-building workshops.");
}
```

Instead of immediately alerting HR, this system gives employees with low autonomy the opportunity to engage in self-directed interventions, promoting a more respectful approach to behavioral correction.

---

### Example 6: **Behavioral Improvement Reports with Autonomy and Competence Metrics**

```python
# Backend: Generate detailed reports showing autonomy and competence growth alongside behavior
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def generateBehaviorReportSDT(employee_metrics):
    plt.plot(employee_metrics['spiteful_actions'], label='Spiteful Actions')
    plt.plot(employee_metrics['cooperative_actions'], label='Cooperative Actions')
    plt.plot(employee_metrics['self_regulation_score'], label='Self-Regulation')
    plt.plot(employee_metrics['perceived_autonomy'], label='Perceived Autonomy')
    plt.legend()
    plt.title('Behavior and Autonomy Over Time')
    plt.savefig('behavior_report_sdt.png')
```

Incorporating SDT principles, these reports visualize not only behavior but also the employee's growth in autonomy and competence, fostering a deeper understanding of progress.

---

### Example 7: **Competence-Based Deprogramming Workshops**

```c
// Backend: Autonomously assign competence-building workshops based on behavior metrics
void assignWorkshopSDT(int employee_id) {
    BehaviorMetricsSDT *metrics = getEmployeeMetricsSDT(employee_id);
    if (metrics->spiteful_actions > 3 && metrics->perceived_autonomy < 5) {
        enrollInWorkshop(employee_id, "Competence-Building: The Key to Collaborative Success");
    }
}
```

Rather than focusing solely on behavior correction, these workshops aim to build competence, aligning with SDT by promoting intrinsic motivation for improvement.

---

### Example 8: **Autonomy-Supportive Reward System for Non-Spiteful Behavior**

```c
// Backend: Reward autonomy-driven non-spiteful behavior
void rewardEmployeeSDT(int employee_id) {
    BehaviorMetricsSDT *metrics = getEmployeeMetricsSDT(employee_id);
    if (metrics->cooperative_actions > 10 && metrics->spiteful_actions == 0 && metrics->perceived_autonomy > 7) {
        addReward(employee_id, "Autonomy-Focused Employee of the Month");
    }
}
```

Employees who consistently exhibit non-spiteful, autonomy-driven behaviors are rewarded, further reinforcing positive behavior and intrinsic motivation.

---

### Summary

This comprehensive tracking and deprogramming system integrates SDT principles into a Full Stack solution. By respecting employee autonomy, fostering competence, and enhancing intrinsic motivation, it provides a respectful, human-centered approach to behavioral management. From real-time dashboards to autonomy-supportive alerts and rewards, the system helps employees grow while fostering a healthy organizational culture.
