To solve systems of nonlinear equations using the **Frozen Divided Difference (FDD) scheme**, we extend the idea of divided differences into a frozen approach where the derivative approximations are fixed after initial calculation. This helps tackle nonlinear problems efficiently by freezing the Jacobian approximations, avoiding recalculations, and reducing computational cost. Below are eight advanced code examples that demonstrate this method's practical application, optimized for real-world performance, AI integration, and automation, while considering scalability and economic feasibility.

### 1. **Initialization and Setup of the System of Nonlinear Equations**
We begin by setting up the system of nonlinear equations to solve. The equations could represent various physical, economic, or engineering models.

```python
import numpy as np

# Example system of nonlinear equations
def system_of_equations(x):
    return np.array([x[0]**2 + x[1]**2 - 1, x[0] * x[1] - 0.5])

# Initial guess for the solution
x0 = np.array([1.0, 1.0])
```
**Reasoning**: We start with a set of nonlinear equations, where `x0` is an initial guess. These functions can be adapted to any real-world problem involving nonlinear relationships, such as optimization in economics or engineering systems.

### 2. **Frozen Divided Difference Approximation of the Jacobian**
In this example, the Jacobian matrix is approximated using divided differences and then frozen, meaning that it remains fixed through multiple iterations to save computational cost.

```python
def frozen_jacobian(f, x, h=1e-5):
    n = len(x)
    J = np.zeros((n, n))
    f0 = f(x)
    
    for i in range(n):
        x_temp = np.copy(x)
        x_temp[i] += h
        J[:, i] = (f(x_temp) - f0) / h  # Divided difference approximation
    
    return J

# Freeze the Jacobian at the initial guess
J_frozen = frozen_jacobian(system_of_equations, x0)
```
**Reasoning**: The divided difference method approximates the Jacobian once at the initial guess. This frozen Jacobian reduces computational overhead, as it's not recomputed in every iteration. This is ideal for systems where the Jacobian does not change significantly.

---

### 3. **Newton's Method Using the Frozen Jacobian**
The solution is iteratively refined using Newton's method with the frozen Jacobian. This allows us to solve the system of nonlinear equations without recalculating the Jacobian at every step.

```python
def frozen_newtons_method(f, J_frozen, x0, tol=1e-6, max_iter=50):
    x = np.copy(x0)
    
    for i in range(max_iter):
        delta_x = np.linalg.solve(J_frozen, -f(x))  # Solve J * delta_x = -f(x)
        x += delta_x
        
        if np.linalg.norm(f(x), ord=2) < tol:
            print(f"Converged in {i+1} iterations.")
            return x
        
    print("Did not converge.")
    return x

# Solve using frozen Newton's method
solution = frozen_newtons_method(system_of_equations, J_frozen, x0)
print("Solution:", solution)
```
**Reasoning**: Newton's method is an effective technique for solving nonlinear systems, and by using the frozen Jacobian, we can greatly reduce computational complexity while still maintaining the convergence characteristics of Newton's method.

### 4. **Handling Infeasibility: Constraints and Penalty Methods**
This example incorporates constraints into the system. If the solution exceeds feasible limits (e.g., in economic models), we use a penalty method to adjust the objective function and keep the solution within bounds.

```python
def penalty_function(x, penalty_weight=1000):
    penalties = 0
    # Example constraint: x[0] >= 0, x[1] <= 2
    if x[0] < 0: penalties += penalty_weight * (x[0]**2)
    if x[1] > 2: penalties += penalty_weight * (x[1] - 2)**2
    return penalties

def penalized_system_of_equations(x):
    return system_of_equations(x) + penalty_function(x)

# Solve the penalized system
solution_penalized = frozen_newtons_method(penalized_system_of_equations, J_frozen, x0)
print("Penalized solution:", solution_penalized)
```
**Reasoning**: The penalty method ensures the solution stays within feasible bounds, important in realistic economic models where solutions violating constraints lead to unrealistic or infeasible results.

### 5. **Incorporating Machine Learning to Refine Solutions**
A simple machine learning-based correction step refines the solution. After an initial approximation using the FDD scheme, we apply a neural network model to reduce residual errors.

```python
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

# Generate training data around the solution
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 2) * 2 - 1  # Random points
y_train = np.array([system_of_equations(x) for x in X_train])

# Train a neural network to minimize residuals
mlp = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=(10,), max_iter=1000)
mlp.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Correct the solution using the trained model
correction = mlp.predict([solution])[0]
corrected_solution = solution - correction
print("Corrected solution:", corrected_solution)
```
**Reasoning**: The neural network provides an additional layer of refinement, helping to correct small residual errors left by the FDD scheme. This hybrid approach leverages AI to improve the accuracy of the final solution.

### 6. **Parallel Computation for Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems**
This code implements parallelized computation for solving large systems of nonlinear equations efficiently, ensuring that the algorithm scales well.

```python
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

# Example system with multiple equations
def large_system_of_equations(x):
    return np.array([x[i]**2 - (i + 1) for i in range(len(x))])

# Parallelize Jacobian freezing and solution computation
def parallel_frozen_jacobian(f, x):
    return Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(frozen_jacobian)(f, x[i]) for i in range(len(x)))

# Use the parallel Jacobian with frozen Newton's method
J_parallel_frozen = parallel_frozen_jacobian(large_system_of_equations, x0)
```
**Reasoning**: Parallelization accelerates the freezing of Jacobian matrices for large systems, enabling the method to efficiently handle larger-scale problems, which is crucial for industrial applications and real-time systems in economics and engineering.

### 7. **Hybrid AI-Augmented FDD for Dynamic Nonlinear Systems**
For dynamic systems, where equations change over time, we implement a hybrid approach combining FDD and reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt the frozen Jacobian over time.

```python
import gym

# Define a custom environment using the frozen difference solver
class FDDEnv(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = np.random.rand(2)  # Initialize the state
        self.action_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=-1, high=1, shape=(2,))
        self.observation_space = gym.spaces.Box(low=-2, high=2, shape=(2,))
    
    def step(self, action):
        new_state = self.state + action
        reward = -np.linalg.norm(system_of_equations(new_state))
        done = reward > -1e-3
        return new_state, reward, done, {}
    
    def reset(self):
        self.state = np.random.rand(2)
        return self.state

# Apply RL to dynamically update solutions over time
env = FDDEnv()
```
**Reasoning**: Reinforcement learning dynamically adapts the solution as the system evolves over time. This hybrid approach is especially useful in real-time systems where the dynamics are non-static, such as economic forecasts or adaptive control systems.

### 8. **Automation with Adaptive Scaling and Economic Considerations**
This example demonstrates adaptive scaling of the problem, automatically adjusting the tolerance and iteration limits based on economic constraints, such as computational budget or time restrictions.

```python
def adaptive_tolerance_and_scale(budget, max_budget=1000):
    scale_factor = min(1, budget / max_budget)
    tol = 1e-6 * scale_factor
    max_iter = int(50 * scale_factor)
    return tol, max_iter

# Scale based on a hypothetical budget
budget = 500
tol, max_iter = adaptive_tolerance_and_scale(budget)
solution_scaled = frozen_newtons_method(system_of_equations, J_frozen, x0, tol, max_iter)
print("Scaled solution:", solution_scaled)
```
**Reasoning**: This adaptive approach tailors the problem's scale to available resources, ensuring realistic economic application. It strikes a balance between computational efficiency and solution accuracy.
