### File Name: **Situational_Awareness_Models.c**

### Introduction
This C code implements various situational awareness models designed to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency in complex environments. It covers several theoretical frameworks, including Endsley's Model of Situational Awareness, Distributed Situational Awareness (DSA), Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), Situational Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), and Normative Situational Awareness Models. Each model features a dedicated structure and associated functions that facilitate the assessment and improvement of situational awareness through perception, information sharing, cognitive workload analysis, and actionable recommendations.

### Summary
The provided C code illustrates several situational awareness models, each designed to enhance understanding and improve decision-making in complex scenarios. It encapsulates the essence of situational awareness through structured data representations and functional assessments, thereby allowing for systematic analysis of awareness levels, cognitive workloads, and group dynamics. By integrating these models, organizations can foster a better operational environment, ensuring higher efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making processes.
