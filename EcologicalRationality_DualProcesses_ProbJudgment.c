### **Key Concepts Integrated in Code:**

1. **Intuitive and Analytical Processes:**  
   - The code separates decision-making into **intuitive** (using heuristics) and **analytical** (weighted logical processing) components, blending them for robust outcomes.

2. **Insight Problem Solving:**  
   - The `solve_insight_problem()` function handles classical logic puzzles, highlighting how insight-driven problem-solving works.

3. **Superadditive Probability Judgment:**  
   - The `superadditive_probability_check()` function ensures that total probabilities donâ€™t exceed logical bounds, identifying cases of cognitive bias.

4. **Ambiguous Probabilities:**  
   - The `resolve_ambiguity()` function manages situations where probabilities represent either **possibilities** or **doubts**, clarifying context.

5. **Dual Process Decision-Making:**  
   - The `dual_process_decision()` function combines **intuitive** and **analytical** processes, enhancing decision-making accuracy.

6. **Adjustments for Context:**  
   - The system adjusts decisions dynamically based on external weights, simulating real-world business logic adjustments.

### **Key Benefits and Deep Value:**
- **Improved Decision-Making:** By integrating **dual processes**, this approach leads to better outcomes by balancing fast intuition and deliberate analysis.
- **Ambiguity Resolution:** Clarifying the context of ambiguous probabilities strengthens decision accuracy.
- **Adaptability in Business:** This framework can adjust to different **weights and contexts**, making it ideal for **business intelligence** and **risk assessment**.

---

### **Use Cases:**
- **Risk Assessment in Finance:** Dual processes can help assess ambiguous investments, balancing gut instinct with rigorous analysis.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Addressing probabilities for ambiguous symptoms can improve diagnostic accuracy.
- **IoT and Distributed Systems:** Real-time decision-making in networks can benefit from balancing intuitive models and analytical adjustments.
