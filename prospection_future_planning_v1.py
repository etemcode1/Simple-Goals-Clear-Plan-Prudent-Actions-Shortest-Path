### **Code Examples**

#### 1. **Future State Simulation**
- **Purpose**: Simulate future states of a system based on current trends and constraints.  
- **Features**: Uses a Markov chain to model future states.  
```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_future_states(transition_matrix, initial_state, steps):
    state = np.array(initial_state)
    states_over_time = [state]
    
    for _ in range(steps):
        state = np.dot(state, transition_matrix)
        states_over_time.append(state)
    
    return states_over_time

# Example usage
transition_matrix = [[0.7, 0.3], [0.4, 0.6]]  # Transition probabilities
initial_state = [1, 0]  # Initial state
steps = 10

future_states = simulate_future_states(transition_matrix, initial_state, steps)
print("Future States:", future_states)
```

#### 2. **Scenario Visualization**
- **Purpose**: Generate visual representations of multiple future scenarios.  
- **Features**: Uses Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic scenario generation.  
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def visualize_scenarios(initial_value, growth_rate, volatility, num_scenarios, time_horizon):
    for _ in range(num_scenarios):
        values = [initial_value]
        for _ in range(time_horizon):
            values.append(values[-1] * (1 + np.random.normal(growth_rate, volatility)))
        plt.plot(values)
    plt.xlabel("Time")
    plt.ylabel("Value")
    plt.title("Future Scenarios")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
visualize_scenarios(initial_value=100, growth_rate=0.05, volatility=0.2, num_scenarios=5, time_horizon=20)
```

---

#### 3. **Time-Centered Goal Planning**
- **Purpose**: Plan goals over time using priority-based scheduling.  
- **Features**: Allocates time and resources to achieve multiple goals optimally.  
```python
def goal_planning(goals, durations, total_time):
    planned = []
    for goal, duration in zip(goals, durations):
        if total_time - duration >= 0:
            planned.append(goal)
            total_time -= duration
    return planned

# Example usage
goals = ["Develop AI Model", "Launch Product", "Market Expansion"]
durations = [10, 15, 20]  # Time in weeks
total_time = 30

plan = goal_planning(goals, durations, total_time)
print("Planned Goals:", plan)
```

---

#### 4. **Possibility Mapping**
- **Purpose**: Create a map of possible outcomes with weights for each scenario.  
- **Features**: Uses fuzzy sets to represent uncertainty.  
```python
def map_possibilities(outcomes, weights):
    possibility_map = {outcome: weight for outcome, weight in zip(outcomes, weights)}
    return possibility_map

# Example usage
outcomes = ["High Growth", "Moderate Growth", "Decline"]
weights = [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]  # Possibility weights

possibilities = map_possibilities(outcomes, weights)
print("Possibility Map:", possibilities)
```

---

#### 5. **Prospection-Aided Decision Tree**
- **Purpose**: Build a decision tree for navigating complex future decisions.  
- **Features**: Optimizes decisions by weighing future outcomes.  
```python
class DecisionNode:
    def __init__(self, name, outcomes=None):
        self.name = name
        self.outcomes = outcomes or []

def build_decision_tree(root, depth, branches):
    if depth == 0:
        return root
    for i in range(branches):
        child = DecisionNode(f"{root.name} -> Option {i + 1}")
        root.outcomes.append(build_decision_tree(child, depth - 1, branches))
    return root

def print_tree(node, level=0):
    print("  " * level + node.name)
    for child in node.outcomes:
        print_tree(child, level + 1)

# Example usage
root = DecisionNode("Start")
tree = build_decision_tree(root, depth=3, branches=2)
print_tree(tree)
```

---

#### 6. **Future Readiness Index**
- **Purpose**: Quantify readiness for future challenges based on weighted factors.  
- **Features**: Outputs a readiness score for actionable insights.  
```python
def future_readiness(factors, weights):
    return sum(f * w for f, w in zip(factors, weights)) / sum(weights)

# Example usage
factors = [0.9, 0.7, 0.8]  # Preparedness levels for different areas
weights = [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]  # Importance weights

readiness_score = future_readiness(factors, weights)
print(f"Future Readiness Index: {readiness_score:.2f}")
```

---

#### 7. **AI-Assisted Prospection**
- **Purpose**: Use an AI model to predict and plan for future outcomes.  
- **Features**: Integrates machine learning for accurate foresight.  
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

def ai_prospection(data, future_steps):
    X = np.array(range(len(data))).reshape(-1, 1)
    y = np.array(data)
    model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
    future = model.predict(np.array(range(len(data), len(data) + future_steps)).reshape(-1, 1))
    return future

# Example usage
historical_data = [100, 105, 110, 120, 130]
future_steps = 5

predictions = ai_prospection(historical_data, future_steps)
print("Future Predictions:", predictions)
```
