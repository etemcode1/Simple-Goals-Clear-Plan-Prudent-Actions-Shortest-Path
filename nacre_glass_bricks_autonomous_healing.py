### **1. Layered Brick Structure Simulation**  
Simulates the stacking of glass bricks joined by flexible poly(borosiloxane) layers, inspired by nacre.  

```python
import numpy as np

def simulate_brick_stack(num_bricks, layer_thickness, glass_strength):
    bricks = np.zeros(num_bricks)
    layers = np.full(num_bricks - 1, layer_thickness)

### **2. Stress Distribution Analysis**  
Calculates stress distribution across glass-polymer interfaces under applied loads.  

```python
def stress_distribution(load, cross_section_area):
    stress = load / cross_section_area
    return stress

load = 500  # in Newtons
area = 50  # in mm²
print(f"Stress: {stress_distribution(load, area):.2f} MPa")
```

### **3. Autonomous Healing Mechanism Simulation**  
Models healing behavior after cracks using poly(borosiloxane) layers.

```python
def heal_crack(crack_length, healing_rate):
    healed_length = crack_length * healing_rate
    return healed_length

print(f"Healed Crack Length: {heal_crack(5, 0.9)} mm")
```

---

### **4. Toughness Optimization Algorithm**  
Finds optimal glass-polymer combinations for maximum toughness.

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def toughness_function(vars):
    glass_thickness, polymer_thickness = vars
    return -(glass_thickness * polymer_thickness * 0.8)  # Arbitrary toughness formula

result = minimize(toughness_function, [10, 0.5], bounds=[(5, 20), (0.1, 1)])
print(f"Optimal design: Glass {result.x[0]} mm, Polymer {result.x[1]} mm")
```

---

### **5. Fracture Energy Calculation**  
Computes fracture energy based on stress and displacement.

```python
def fracture_energy(stress, displacement):
    return 0.5 * stress * displacement

print(f"Fracture Energy: {fracture_energy(300, 0.02)} J")
```

---

### **6. Cyclic Load Testing**  
Simulates repeated loading and healing of the structure.

```python
def cyclic_load_test(cycles, load, healing_factor):
    for cycle in range(1, cycles + 1):
        effective_load = load * healing_factor ** cycle
        print(f"Cycle {cycle}: Load {effective_load:.2f} N")

cyclic_load_test(5, 1000, 0.95)
```

---

### **7. Finite Element Modeling Integration**  
Exports data to a FEM software for complex simulations.

```python
def export_to_fem(geometry, material_props):
    with open("fem_input.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write(f"Geometry: {geometry}\nMaterial Properties: {material_props}")

export_to_fem("Rectangular", {"E": 70e3, "ν": 0.2})
```

---

### **8. Adaptive Control for Healing Efficiency**  
Implements adaptive control strategies to enhance healing efficiency dynamically.

```python
def adaptive_control(current_efficiency, desired_efficiency):
    adjustment = (desired_efficiency - current_efficiency) * 0.1
    return current_efficiency + adjustment

print(f"New Efficiency: {adaptive_control(0.85, 0.95):.2f}")
```
