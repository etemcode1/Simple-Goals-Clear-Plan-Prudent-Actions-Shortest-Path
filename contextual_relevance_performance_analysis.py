Here are **7 advanced code examples** showcasing the use of contextual relevance and contextual performance with strong logical structures and brilliant mathematical underpinnings.

---

### **1. Calculating Contextual Relevance with Cosine Similarity**  
**Purpose:** Evaluate how relevant a context vector is to a given query using cosine similarity.

```python
import numpy as np

# Context and query vectors
context_vector = np.array([0.4, 0.6, 0.8])
query_vector = np.array([0.5, 0.7, 0.2])

# Cosine similarity formula
cosine_similarity = np.dot(context_vector, query_vector) / (
    np.linalg.norm(context_vector) * np.linalg.norm(query_vector)
)

print(f"Contextual Relevance (Cosine Similarity): {cosine_similarity:.4f}")
```

### **2. Contextual Performance Scoring via Weighted Logistic Regression**  
**Purpose:** Model performance in context-sensitive tasks using logistic regression with weighted factors.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Simulated contextual features and outcomes
features = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # 100 samples, 3 context features
weights = np.array([0.5, 1.2, 0.8])  # Contextual weights
weighted_features = features * weights
outcomes = (weighted_features.sum(axis=1) > 1.5).astype(int)

# Train logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(weighted_features, outcomes)

# Contextual performance score
score = model.score(weighted_features, outcomes)
print(f"Contextual Performance Score: {score:.4f}")
```

---

### **3. Relevance Ranking with Matrix Factorization**  
**Purpose:** Rank contextual relevance using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

```python
from numpy.linalg import svd

# Simulated relevance matrix: rows (contexts), cols (queries)
relevance_matrix = np.random.rand(5, 5)

# Perform SVD
U, S, Vt = svd(relevance_matrix)
top_contexts = np.argsort(S)[-3:]  # Top 3 singular values

print(f"Top Contexts by Relevance: {top_contexts}")
```

---

### **4. Contextual Relevance via Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence**  
**Purpose:** Measure the divergence between a context distribution and target relevance.

```python
from scipy.stats import entropy

# Context and target relevance distributions
context_distribution = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
target_distribution = np.array([0.1, 0.4, 0.5])

# KL Divergence
kl_divergence = entropy(context_distribution, target_distribution)
print(f"Contextual Relevance (KL Divergence): {kl_divergence:.4f}")
```

---

### **5. Evaluating Contextual Adaptability with Markov Chains**  
**Purpose:** Model transitions in performance across contextual states using Markov chains.

```python
import numpy as np

# Transition matrix for contextual states
transition_matrix = np.array([
    [0.7, 0.2, 0.1],
    [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],
    [0.4, 0.3, 0.3],
])

# Initial state probabilities
initial_state = np.array([1, 0, 0])

# Contextual performance after 3 steps
state_after_3_steps = np.linalg.matrix_power(transition_matrix, 3) @ initial_state
print(f"Contextual Performance After 3 Steps: {state_after_3_steps}")
```

---

### **6. Contextual Performance Forecasting with Time Series Analysis**  
**Purpose:** Use ARIMA to forecast performance under evolving contexts.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import numpy as np

# Simulated contextual performance data
performance_data = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(100)) + 50

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(performance_data, order=(1, 1, 1))
fitted_model = model.fit()

# Forecast next 5 points
forecast = fitted_model.forecast(steps=5)
print(f"Forecasted Contextual Performance: {forecast}")
```

---

### **7. Multi-Objective Contextual Optimization with Linear Programming**  
**Purpose:** Optimize multiple performance metrics under contextual constraints.

```python
from scipy.optimize import linprog

# Coefficients for performance metrics to maximize
objective = [-3, -4]  # Negated for maximization in linprog

# Contextual constraints (A @ x <= b)
A = [[1, 2], [3, 1], [-1, 0]]
b = [6, 9, 0]

# Bounds for decision variables
x_bounds = (0, None)

# Solve linear program
result = linprog(c=objective, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, x_bounds])
print(f"Optimal Contextual Performance: {result.x}")
```

These **advanced examples** integrate mathematical rigor with **machine learning**, **statistics**, and **optimization techniques**, providing robust frameworks to measure and enhance both contextual relevance and contextual performance in complex systems.
