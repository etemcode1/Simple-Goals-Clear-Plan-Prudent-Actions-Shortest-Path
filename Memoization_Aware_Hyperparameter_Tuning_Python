### **Advanced Code Examples**

#### 1. **Basic Memoization for Hyperparameter Results**
   - **Purpose:** Cache results of hyperparameter configurations to avoid redundant training.
   - **Benefits:** Minimizes re-computation with a lightweight solution.

   ```python
   hyperparameter_cache = {}

   def train_and_evaluate(hyperparams):
       """Train and evaluate a model with the given hyperparameters."""
       key = tuple(hyperparams.items())
       if key in hyperparameter_cache:
           return hyperparameter_cache[key]

       # Simulated training and evaluation
       accuracy = sum(hyperparams.values()) % 1  # Example evaluation metric
       hyperparameter_cache[key] = accuracy
       return accuracy

   # Example usage
   params = {"learning_rate": 0.01, "batch_size": 32}
   result = train_and_evaluate(params)
   print("Cached Result:", hyperparameter_cache)
   ```

---

#### 2. **Integration with Grid Search**
   - **Purpose:** Integrate memoization with grid search for efficient hyperparameter tuning.
   - **Benefits:** Avoids re-evaluating configurations already explored.

   ```python
   from itertools import product

   def grid_search(param_grid):
       """Perform memoized grid search."""
       for values in product(*param_grid.values()):
           hyperparams = dict(zip(param_grid.keys(), values))
           yield train_and_evaluate(hyperparams)

   # Example usage
   param_grid = {
       "learning_rate": [0.01, 0.1],
       "batch_size": [32, 64],
   }
   results = list(grid_search(param_grid))
   print("Grid Search Results:", results)
   ```

---

#### 3. **Memoization with Bayesian Optimization**
   - **Purpose:** Accelerate Bayesian optimization by caching evaluated points.
   - **Benefits:** Enhances the efficiency of probabilistic hyperparameter tuning.

   ```python
   from skopt import gp_minimize

   def objective(params):
       """Objective function with memoization for Bayesian optimization."""
       hyperparams = {"learning_rate": params[0], "batch_size": int(params[1])}
       return -train_and_evaluate(hyperparams)  # Minimize negative accuracy

   # Example usage
   space = [(0.001, 0.1), (16, 128)]
   result = gp_minimize(objective, space, n_calls=10)
   print("Optimized Parameters:", result.x)
   ```

---

#### 4. **Distributed Tuning with Shared Cache**
   - **Purpose:** Share memoization results across distributed workers.
   - **Benefits:** Scales efficiently across multiple machines.

   ```python
   from multiprocessing import Manager, Pool

   def distributed_train(hyperparams, shared_cache):
       """Train with shared memoization."""
       key = tuple(hyperparams.items())
       if key in shared_cache:
           return shared_cache[key]

       accuracy = sum(hyperparams.values()) % 1
       shared_cache[key] = accuracy
       return accuracy

   # Example usage
   manager = Manager()
   shared_cache = manager.dict()
   with Pool(4) as pool:
       params_list = [{"learning_rate": 0.01, "batch_size": 32}, {"learning_rate": 0.1, "batch_size": 64}]
       results = pool.starmap(distributed_train, [(params, shared_cache) for params in params_list])
   print("Shared Cache Results:", shared_cache)
   ```

---

#### 5. **Memoization-Aware Early Stopping**
   - **Purpose:** Use memoization with early stopping to save further computations for poor configurations.
   - **Benefits:** Stops training early when the cached results indicate poor performance.

   ```python
   def early_stopping_train(hyperparams, threshold=0.5):
       """Train with early stopping based on cached results."""
       key = tuple(hyperparams.items())
       if key in hyperparameter_cache:
           return hyperparameter_cache[key]

       accuracy = 0
       for epoch in range(10):  # Simulate epochs
           accuracy += 0.1  # Incremental improvement
           if accuracy >= threshold:
               break
       hyperparameter_cache[key] = accuracy
       return accuracy

   # Example usage
   params = {"learning_rate": 0.01, "batch_size": 64}
   result = early_stopping_train(params)
   print("Result with Early Stopping:", result)
   ```

#### 6. **Visualization of Tuning Efficiency**
   - **Purpose:** Visualize time saved by memoization-aware tuning.
   - **Benefits:** Offers insights into performance improvements.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   configurations = list(range(1, 21))
   original_time = [x * 2 for x in configurations]  # Simulate original times
   memoized_time = [x for x in configurations]     # Simulate optimized times

   plt.plot(configurations, original_time, label="Original Time")
   plt.plot(configurations, memoized_time, label="Memoized Time")
   plt.xlabel("Configurations")
   plt.ylabel("Time (seconds)")
   plt.legend()
   plt.title("Memoization Efficiency in Hyperparameter Tuning")
   plt.show()
   ```

---

#### 7. **Integration with ML Pipelines**
   - **Purpose:** Apply memoization-awareness in end-to-end ML training pipelines.
   - **Benefits:** Demonstrates practical applicability in real-world systems.

   ```python
   def ml_pipeline(hyperparams):
       """Simulate an ML training pipeline."""
       key = tuple(hyperparams.items())
       if key in hyperparameter_cache:
           return hyperparameter_cache[key]

       # Simulate training process
       accuracy = (hyperparams["learning_rate"] * 100) / hyperparams["batch_size"]
       hyperparameter_cache[key] = accuracy
       return accuracy

   # Example usage
   params = {"learning_rate": 0.05, "batch_size": 32}
   pipeline_result = ml_pipeline(params)
   print("Pipeline Result:", pipeline_result)
   ```
