    if (t.trust_level > 8) {
        printf("Resolving '%s' with trusted input from %s.\n", c.issue, t.party);
    } else {
        printf("Delaying resolution due to low trust.\n");
    }

    time_t now = time(NULL);
    double days_left = difftime(conflict.resolution_deadline, now) / (60 * 60 * 24);
    if (days_left < 1) {
        printf("Urgent: Resolve '%s' immediately.\n", conflict.issue);
    } else {

    if (trust->trust_level < 5) {
        printf("Implementing trust-building activities with %s.\n", trust->person);
        trust->trust_level += 3;
    } else {
