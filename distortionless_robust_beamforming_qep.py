### Example 1: **Distortionless Beamforming Weight Calculation**
Calculates optimal beamforming weights to maintain distortionless output, achieving interference mitigation without altering signal properties.
```python
import numpy as np

def distortionless_beamforming_weights(R, a):
    """Calculate distortionless beamforming weights."""
    weights = np.linalg.solve(R, a) / (np.conj(a.T) @ np.linalg.solve(R, a))
    return weights

# Example usage
R = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])  # Covariance matrix
a = np.array([1, 0.5])  # Steering vector
weights = distortionless_beamforming_weights(R, a)
print("Beamforming Weights:", weights)
```

### Example 2: **Robust Beamforming with Diagonal Loading**
Applies diagonal loading to improve robustness of beamforming in noisy environments, essential in practical scenarios where noise statistics are uncertain.
```python
def robust_beamforming(R, a, delta):
    """Apply diagonal loading for robust beamforming."""
    R_loaded = R + delta * np.eye(len(R))
    weights = np.linalg.solve(R_loaded, a) / (np.conj(a.T) @ np.linalg.solve(R_loaded, a))
    return weights

# Example usage
delta = 0.1  # Loading factor
robust_weights = robust_beamforming(R, a, delta)
print("Robust Beamforming Weights:", robust_weights)
```

### Example 3: **Quadratic Eigenvalue Problem (QEP) Solution for Beam Stability**
Solves the QEP to analyze system stability, essential for evaluating the stability of beam patterns under parameter changes.
```python
from scipy.linalg import eig

def solve_qep(M, C, K):
    """Solve the quadratic eigenvalue problem Mx^2 + Cx + K = 0."""
    A = np.block([[np.zeros_like(M), np.eye(len(M))], [-K, -C]])
    B = np.block([[np.eye(len(M)), np.zeros_like(M)], [np.zeros_like(M), M]])
    eigenvalues, _ = eig(A, B)
    return eigenvalues

# Example usage
M = np.array([[2, 0], [0, 1]])  # Mass matrix
C = np.array([[0.1, 0.05], [0.05, 0.1]])  # Damping matrix
K = np.array([[1, 0.5], [0.5, 1]])  # Stiffness matrix
eigenvalues = solve_qep(M, C, K)
print("QEP Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
```

### Example 4: **Directional Constraint for Robust Beamforming**
Applies a directional constraint to steer the beam toward desired angles while maintaining robustness, ideal for adaptive direction selection.
```python
def directional_constraint_beamforming(R, a, direction_vector):
    """Add directional constraints for controlled beam steering."""
    constraint_matrix = np.outer(direction_vector, direction_vector.conj())
    weights = np.linalg.solve(R + constraint_matrix, a) / (np.conj(a.T) @ np.linalg.solve(R + constraint_matrix, a))
    return weights

# Example usage
direction_vector = np.array([1, 0.8])  # Desired direction constraint
directional_weights = directional_constraint_beamforming(R, a, direction_vector)
print("Directional Constraint Weights:", directional_weights)
```

---

### Example 5: **Optimizing Beam Pattern with Quadratic Programming (QP)**
Optimizes beam pattern by minimizing interference while meeting quadratic constraints for effective interference management.
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def optimize_beam_pattern(R, a, interference_level):
    """Optimize beam pattern with quadratic programming."""
    def objective(w):
        return np.real(np.conj(w.T) @ R @ w)

    constraints = [{'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.real(np.conj(a.T) @ w) - 1}]
    result = minimize(objective, np.ones(len(a)), constraints=constraints)
    return result.x

# Example usage
interference_level = 0.05
optimized_weights = optimize_beam_pattern(R, a, interference_level)
print("Optimized Beam Pattern Weights:", optimized_weights)
```

---

### Example 6: **Beamforming Power Calculation Across Array Elements**
Calculates power distribution across elements of the array to monitor signal gain and identify any imbalances in the beam pattern.
```python
def calculate_beamforming_power(weights, signal_vector):
    """Calculate power distribution across array elements."""
    power = np.abs(np.conj(weights.T) @ signal_vector) ** 2
    return power

# Example usage
signal_vector = np.array([1, 0.5])  # Input signal across array elements
beam_power = calculate_beamforming_power(weights, signal_vector)
print("Beamforming Power:", beam_power)
```

---

### Example 7: **Visualizing Beam Pattern in Polar Plot**
Visualizes beam pattern across angles using polar coordinates to provide a clear view of the beam's directionality and robustness.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_beam_pattern(weights, theta_range):
    """Plot the beam pattern in polar coordinates."""
    pattern = [np.abs(np.dot(weights, np.exp(1j * theta))) for theta in theta_range]
    plt.polar(theta_range, pattern)
    plt.title("Beam Pattern")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
theta_range = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)  # Angle range
plot_beam_pattern(weights, theta_range)
```
