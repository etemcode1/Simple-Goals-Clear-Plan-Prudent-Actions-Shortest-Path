### Example 1: **Edge Processing for Early Filtering**
Edge processing reduces data sent to central servers by filtering unnecessary frames early, enhancing focus in vision systems.
```python
import cv2

def edge_processing(frame):
    """Apply edge detection and thresholding to filter unnecessary data."""
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    edges = cv2.Canny(gray, threshold1=50, threshold2=150)
    return edges

# Example usage
frame = cv2.imread('sample_frame.jpg')
filtered_frame = edge_processing(frame)
cv2.imwrite('filtered_edge_frame.jpg', filtered_frame)
```

---

### Example 2: **Focus-Weighted Region of Interest (ROI) Processing**
This example focuses processing on areas with higher focus or activity levels, saving resources for relevant information.
```python
def focus_weighted_roi(frame, rois):
    """Process only focused regions of interest (ROIs) in the frame."""
    processed_rois = []
    for roi in rois:
        x, y, w, h = roi
        region = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
        processed = cv2.GaussianBlur(region, (5, 5), 0)
        processed_rois.append(processed)
    return processed_rois

# Example usage
frame = cv2.imread('sample_frame.jpg')
rois = [(50, 50, 100, 100), (200, 200, 50, 50)]  # Example ROI coordinates
processed_rois = focus_weighted_roi(frame, rois)
print("Processed ROIs:", processed_rois)
```

### Example 3: **Adaptive Resolution Scaling Based on Bandwidth**
This example dynamically scales resolution based on available bandwidth, ensuring high relevance in resource-limited networks.
```python
import cv2

def adaptive_resolution(frame, bandwidth):
    """Adjust frame resolution based on bandwidth."""
    scale = 0.5 if bandwidth < 5 else 1
    width = int(frame.shape[1] * scale)
    height = int(frame.shape[0] * scale)
    return cv2.resize(frame, (width, height))

# Example usage
frame = cv2.imread('sample_frame.jpg')
scaled_frame = adaptive_resolution(frame, bandwidth=3)  # Low bandwidth scenario
cv2.imwrite('adaptive_scaled_frame.jpg', scaled_frame)
```

---

### Example 4: **Smart Task Distribution to Nodes**
Distributes vision tasks based on node capability and network load, enhancing scalability and system response.
```python
from random import choice

def distribute_tasks(nodes, tasks):
    """Distribute tasks to nodes based on capability and load."""
    distribution = {}
    for task in tasks:
        capable_nodes = [node for node in nodes if node['capacity'] >= task['demand']]
        selected_node = choice(capable_nodes)
        distribution[task['id']] = selected_node['id']
    return distribution

# Example usage
nodes = [{'id': 1, 'capacity': 10}, {'id': 2, 'capacity': 5}]
tasks = [{'id': 'detect_faces', 'demand': 5}, {'id': 'track_objects', 'demand': 7}]
task_distribution = distribute_tasks(nodes, tasks)
print("Task Distribution:", task_distribution)
```

---

### Example 5: **Prioritization Based on Focus Scores**
This example assigns focus scores to detected objects and processes only those that meet a certain threshold, ensuring relevance.
```python
def focus_priority(objects, threshold=0.7):
    """Process only objects with focus scores above threshold."""
    prioritized = [obj for obj in objects if obj['focus_score'] >= threshold]
    return prioritized

# Example usage
objects = [{'id': 'obj1', 'focus_score': 0.8}, {'id': 'obj2', 'focus_score': 0.5}]
prioritized_objects = focus_priority(objects)
print("Prioritized Objects:", prioritized_objects)
```

---

### Example 6: **Distributed Object Detection with Fallback**
This example sends frames to multiple nodes for processing, with a fallback for frames that fail processing, optimizing reliability.
```python
def distributed_detection(nodes, frame):
    """Distribute detection to nodes and retry on failure."""
    for node in nodes:
        result = node['detect'](frame)
        if result is not None:
            return result
    return "Failed processing; Fallback triggered."

# Example usage (Assume nodes have a mock 'detect' function)
nodes = [{'id': 1, 'detect': lambda frame: None}, {'id': 2, 'detect': lambda frame: "Processed"}]
frame = cv2.imread('sample_frame.jpg')
detection_result = distributed_detection(nodes, frame)
print("Detection Result:", detection_result)
```

---

### Example 7: **Focus-Based Model Switching**
Switches to models with varying complexity based on detected focus, allowing high-accuracy processing only when needed.
```python
def model_switcher(focus_level):
    """Switch models based on focus level."""
    if focus_level > 0.8:
        return "High-Accuracy Model"
    elif focus_level > 0.5:
        return "Balanced Model"
    else:
        return "Lightweight Model"

# Example usage
focus_level = 0.85  # Simulate a high focus level
selected_model = model_switcher(focus_level)
print("Selected Model:", selected_model)
```

These examples offer a robust framework for enhancing the focus and efficiency of distributed computer vision systems by intelligently managing resources, prioritizing relevant data, and distributing tasks effectively. The techniques optimize both processing power and network resources, enabling scalable and highly focused vision applications across distributed environments.
